# SewBugTips
Looking for a new hobby? Do you have an interest in sewing? Unsure of sewing terminology? You've reached the right place! Sew Bug Tips is a site which provides SEWING 101 information with images, fabric terminology, reference links and sew much more!

While learning how to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript I was tasked with creating a project to demonstrate my coding skills. I choose to create a site focused on my hobby - sewing! This site is intended to help anyone interested in sewing, but may feel a little intimated by the jargon. In version 1.0, the site focus was on fabric precuts. In version 2.0, the site includes additional JavaScript to display information as referenced below. It also includes a new page which converts inches to cm. The contact us form inputs will now be saved and the phone number field is now a required field with validation in regular expression.
